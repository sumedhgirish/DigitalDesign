# Introduction

The design of circuits and chip based components occurs as follows.

    ASICS (Chip) <--(Generated by a computer)--- Set of intructions <--(Goverened by a language)--- HDL <--(Abstracted to higher code)--- VHDL/Verilog

Verilog := definition of behavior of a chip or cicuit

The intended learning route := learn how hardware components work -> learn how **good** hardware components work

This presents a shift in how hardware is expected to be designed, not on breadboards as you do to learn it, but on chips.
  
  
IT IS NOT THE SYNTAX OF THE LANGUAGE THAT MATTERS. I REPEAT IT IS **NOT** THE SYNTAX BUT THE SEMANTICS AND LOGIC BEHIND IT. If a software program tells us
how to go from point A to point B on a map, then this subject is about building the map.


THe point is not that it works in software. It is that it works in hardware. I rather prefer my model scary but working, than cute but worthless.

discrete information ---(digital circuit)--> output(other discrete info)


# How to write verilog code

We use 2 files, 1 to implement code and another to test the code

    1. teshbench.v
    2. modules.v

Syntax

```{.v}
module function_name(ports)
    // code
endmodule
```
